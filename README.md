# JadedTweaks
Pretty sure you can find better code anywhere. 
That said, do whatever you want. Call it yours, give it a name, pet it, feed it or chop it up for parts.
Don't care.

Theoretically this mod "should" only require Forge. However it won't do much if just Forge is installed. When specific mods or ores or combinations are detected it will load the changes. I make no promises it will work outside my packs. 

## Ore based changes:
* if Tin is detected * adds tin recipe for buckets
* if Aluminum or aluminium is detected it adds a bucket recipe
* if copper is detected it adds a copper recipe for buckets

## Mod based changes:
* Botania + ExNihilo * removes Terraform wand (giant piles of dirt not good in skyblock)
* ExtraUtilities + ExNihilo * adds a cheaper recipe for the basic builder's wand
